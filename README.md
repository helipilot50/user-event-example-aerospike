# User Event Example

## Problem
You store a number of events, related to a specific user ID, for a period of time. In this example, the time period is 90 days. Each event contains a time stamp, an action and a campaign (category).

In real time, you need to calculate number of times a specific user has a specific action, for a specific campaign.

What is the best way to model data for this in Aerospike?
